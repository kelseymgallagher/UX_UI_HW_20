        <b>Problem</b>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Equitable Giving Circle mainly builds their audience from their Instagram account, which directs them to their website where users can partake in donating or volunteering their time with the non-profit. However, many users find their website confusing and hard to navigate, as the mission of the non-profit is not clear and the overall layout is overwhelming. 
<ol><li>Text-heavy layout</li>
    <li> Unclear mission statement</li>
    <li>Confusing tab navigation</li>
    <li>Overwhelming to navigate website</li></ol>
    </p>
<p>
    <b>Goal</b> </p>
    <p>Our overall goal was to improve these things for both desktop and mobile:</p>

    <p>
        <b>Design Process</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>User research and findings</li>
            <li>Ideation design</li>
                <li>Affinity diagram and empathy map</li>
                    <li>Usability testing and findings</li>
                        <li>Interactive wireframing and prototyping</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <b>My Role and Team

        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        I worked on the interaction/visual design and UX/UI thinking, along with my two team members. When it came to presenting, I primarily concentrated on the ideation process.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>The Research</b>
    </p>

    <p>We posted a survey on Facebook Groups and sent it to friends and family to research the habits of people with expendable income, who are interested in getting involved in their communty.</p>
    <p>We found that word of mouth and social media are the best ways for participants to find organizations to donate money to.
    </p>
    <p>Additionally, users want to learn about non profit priorities and initiatives as well as their values as an organization, prior to making a final decision in regards to donations.</p>

    </div>

    <p>
        <b>Target Users</b>
    </p>
    <p>People with expendable income, looking to get involved in their communty, specifically the Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) community.

        Our interview findings helped us create our two target personas: someone volunteering their time and someone donating money.

        <p>
            <b>User Interviews</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            We interviewed people from different backgrounds, who live in the Portland area, in order to learn more about their view of the current website. 
        </p>

        <p>
            “It’s hard for me to navigate around the website because of all the text, I just want to be able grasp what they do and then decide my how I’d like to be involved.”
        </p>

        <p>
            “Not sure if the navigation terms are clear. They seem to be using all “P’s” but that might be hurting clarity.”
        </p>

        <p>

“I am not sure what the organization does exactly. I get they help the BIPOC community but not sure how.”
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Ideation Process</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            We put our findings into an affinity diagram.
        </p>

 <div class="Affinity">
         <img src="Images/affinity diagram (1).png" alt="affinitymap">
    
          </div>
         
          <p>
            We sorted our findings into an “I Like, I Wish, What if” Ideation.
          </p>

    <div class="Ilikeiwish">
            <img src="Images/I like I wish What if.png" alt="IlikeIwish">
       
         </div>

         <p>We categorized our findings and red dot ranked them.</p>
